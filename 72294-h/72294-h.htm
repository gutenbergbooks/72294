<p class="no-indent">To the minds of most children and a good
many older persons, reindeer suggest Santa
Claus, and no more. But the reindeer is
one of man’s very necessary domestic animals;
it affords a means for reclaiming vast
sub-Arctic regions that now lie waste; and
in Alaska the government of the United
States has introduced reindeer and encouraged
the raising of them, till now they are
a source of wealth to the territory. To tell
the story of the reindeer in our northerly
territory is the purpose of the present little
volume. Mr. William T. Lopp, the author,
has been concerned with the government’s
work in giving the reindeer to the natives
of Alaska since the work was begun in the
’90’s, and it was he who drove a herd of
reindeer seven hundred miles for the relief
of the whalers at Point Barrow in 1897.
This story of <em>White Sox</em> is, then, the work
of an authority on the reindeer; and the
publishers feel that it is worthy of its place in
Animal Life Series beside <em>Matka</em>, Dr. David
Starr Jordan’s classic story of the fur seal</p>

<p>This story will be read by boys and girls in
Alaska who know their fathers’ herds of reindeer
“like a book,” or better than a book; and it will
be read by other boys and girls who never saw a
reindeer and think of them only as strange and
wonderful creatures that live among the snows in
a far-off northern region. I hardly know whether
we enjoy more hearing the story of our own domestic
animals or the story of strange animals that
we have never seen. So I can hardly guess whether
this story will be read with more interest in Alaska
or in Maine and Florida and California. But it
will be read with lively interest wherever it may go.</p>

<p>When I was Commissioner of Education at
Washington, in the Department of the Interior,
people often asked me how it happened that my
office had anything to do with such a distant and
unrelated activity as the reindeer industry. I told
them that this was one of the finest examples of
real education for real life with which I had ever
had to do. I found the subject tremendously interesting.
Dr. Sheldon Jackson, who introduced domestic
reindeer into Alaska, was then alive and was
one of the most vigorous and adventurous and interesting
members of my staff. Very soon Mr. Lopp,
who was at that time a District Superintendent in
Alaska, came on to Washington to arrange with the
new Commissioner for the more complete organization<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
of the reindeer industry and for its further
development.</p>

<p>I found Mr. Lopp one of those rare men who
think more than they talk. We very soon got
together, became acquainted with each other, and
settled down to the work that we had to do together.
I learned to appreciate his intimate knowledge
of the reindeer business and its use in the
making of better living conditions and a better life
for those Alaskans who live in the reindeer country.
I learned to value his personal devotion to the great
work in which he was engaged. The friendship
that grew up between us, through our official relations,
is one which I have greatly prized, from that
time down to the present day; and accordingly I
have welcomed this story of his most warmly, and
I am sure it will be welcomed by a wide circle of
readers.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="I">I<br>
<span class="smcap">Astray from the Herd</span></h2>

<p>White Sox opened his eyes, winked them several
times, and looked about him. Not a thing could
he see except his mother. She was resting on a
bed of moss close beside him, wide awake, chewing
her cud. He knew he had not slept very long because
it was still daylight. But the daylight was
gray and damp, for the sides and roof of his bedroom
were of fog,—fog so thick that it walled
them in completely.</p>

<p>“Mother,” he said anxiously, “do you think we
shall ever find our way back to the big herd?”</p>

<p>Mother Reindeer looked at him for a moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
without speaking, and went on grinding the wad
of food in her mouth—chew, chew, chew. Then
she turned her head this way and that, as if listening
for any sound that might be heard.</p>

<p>“I’m beginning to think the whole world is made
of fog,” complained White Sox. “We’ve been
wandering about in it for two days—here and
there, up and down—without so much as scenting
another reindeer or hearing a sound. Mother,
I’m getting dreadfully worried.”</p>

<p>Mother Reindeer looked at him again. Her
kind eyes were full of patience. She did not seem
a bit worried about things like fog or being lost.</p>

<p>White Sox thought they had gone straying in
search of better moss fields and had become separated
from the herd by the heavy mist. He never
dreamed that his mother was taking him to school.
No, indeed!</p>

<p>“Mother,” he said, speaking a little louder,
“what if we have been going farther away all the
time and never find our way back to the big herd
on the sea beach?”</p>

<p>Mother Reindeer swallowed her cud. “Nonsense!”
she answered. “When the fog lifts we
shall be able to see where we are. We have better
moss here than down on the sea beach, and no
mosquitoes to bother us. There’s nothing to worry
about.”</p>

<p>“But, mother! it is very lonesome here. There
isn’t a fox or a ptarmigan, not even an owl or a
mouse,” White Sox complained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p>Then he rose and stretched himself. He was
five months old, and he had never been away from
the sea beach before. He tried to look through
the fog—this way and that way—but he was
afraid of losing sight of his mother. He did not go
more than a couple of yards from her.</p>

<p>“This awful stillness makes me unhappy,” he
said. “I want to hear the sound of the cowbells, the
yelps of the collies, and the shouts of the herders.”</p>

<p>Mother Reindeer watched him with kindly eyes.
She was very proud of White Sox. He was her
fifteenth fawn, and the smartest, handsomest, and
most graceful and agile in the big herd.</p>

<p>He was very tall. His body was slender and well
proportioned. His head was finely shaped and
held very high; his horns were still in the velvet,
and they were beautiful. His hair was of the darkest
shade of brown—all except his legs, which,
from the hoofs to the knees, were as white and
smooth as the skin of a winter weasel, and his nose,
which looked as if it had been dipped halfway to
his eyes into a pail of milk.</p>

<p>Yes, indeed! Mother Reindeer had good reason
to be proud of White Sox. He was strong as well
as handsome; only a few hours after he was born
he had been able to run with the other fawns and
take care of himself. Now, at five months, he
could outrun them all. And, strange as it may
appear, all the other mothers in the big herd admitted
that there was not another fawn to compare
with White Sox.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>Just at that moment, while Mother Reindeer
was thinking about these things, a gentle breeze
from the northwest blew in her direction and kissed
the tip of her nose. She sprang quickly to her feet.
She stretched her graceful neck, lifted her upper lip
slightly, and sniffed the breeze.</p>
<br>

  <img class="w100" src="images/image004.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">“White Sox turned his nose in the same direction as hers,
and sniffed, and sniffed, and sniffed.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>“What is it?” White Sox asked quickly.
“Mother, do you scent the big herd?”</p>

<p>Mother Reindeer was nodding her head upward
and downward. White Sox turned his nose in the
same direction as hers, and sniffed, and sniffed,
and sniffed.</p>

<p>“Come!” cried Mother Reindeer. “Let’s be
off!”</p>

<p>Away they went—right through the thick fog,
just as if it had not been there at all. After they
had gone a few miles, the heavy mist began to lift.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
They could see a little farther, then still farther,
and at last, on a low ridge straight ahead of them,
White Sox caught sight of moving forms.</p>

<p>“Mother! Look, look! It’s the big herd!” he
shouted joyfully.</p>

<p>He was about to rush toward them, when his
mother spoke.</p>

<p>“Not so fast, my son,” she said. “That is a
herd of caribou. They are our wild cousins.”</p>

<p>White Sox was very much surprised. “Our wild
cousins?” he repeated slowly. Then he became
greatly excited. “Oh, mother, I’m so glad! I’ve
always wanted to see our wild cousins. How lucky
we are! Come, let’s hurry!”</p>

<p>“No, no, my son! You have many lessons to
learn,” she said kindly. “Our wild cousins do not
know we are coming to visit them. They have not
scented us, because the wind is blowing from them
to us. They will be startled when they see us. We
must move very slowly. If we rush toward them,
they will run away.”</p>

<p>As White Sox and his mother moved toward
the herd of white caribou, they left the last of the
fog behind and could see their cousins quite
plainly.</p>

<p>“They look exactly like us,” said White Sox,
after watching them for a little while.</p>

<p>“Look again, my son,” said Mother Reindeer.</p>

<p>But at that moment the caribou caught sight
of the strangers. They quickly bunched together,
with heads erect, and watched them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>Mother Reindeer paused. White Sox stopped
also.</p>

<p>“No, mother, I was wrong,” he said. “I can
see our cousins plainer now. Their bodies are
more slender than those of the reindeer in our
herd. Their legs and necks are longer. They hold
their heads higher. There are no spotted or white
ones among them.”</p>

<p>“Very true,” said Mother Reindeer. She liked
to have White Sox find out things for himself.
“The spotted and white ones are found only in
the herds that live with man and serve him.
Come, we will go to our wild cousins now. They
are frightened. Walk very slowly, and pay attention
to what I tell you.”</p>

<p>The caribou stood at attention as White Sox
and his mother came up to them. To White
Sox they seemed very shy and nervous, but he
supposed that was because they had not been
expecting company.</p>

<p>“Mother,” he whispered, “why do they all
stare at me so?”</p>

<p>“You are the first white-legged and white-nosed
fawn they have ever seen,” she told him. Then
she introduced him to them all.</p>

<p>White Sox held his head as high as theirs, but
he behaved very nicely while they admired his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
beautiful markings. While his mother was greeting
the older cousins, the younger ones gathered
about him and invited him to join in their play.
But White Sox was not in a playful mood. He
was curious to learn more about these strange
cousins; so he went back to his mother.</p>

<p>“Have you been here before, mother?” he
asked. “Our wild cousins seem to know you
quite well.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my son. I have often made visits to the
caribou at this time of the year,” Mother Reindeer
said. “But run away and eat your supper
with the fawns. Keep your eyes and ears open,
and learn all you can of their life and habits.”</p>

<p>White Sox was very happy. This new world
seemed a beautiful place to him. From the top
of the ridge he could see for a long distance in
every direction. Life was not a bit lonesome now.
He skipped and frisked with the fawns, and ate
his supper of moss with them in a tiny hollow
just below the ridge where the big caribou were
eating. Oh, it was the most delicious moss he
had ever tasted! When sleeping time came, he
went back to his mother, too tired and drowsy
to say a word.</p>

<p>But do you suppose the wild caribou were going
to allow the lazy fellow to sleep in peace? Not
a bit of it! Four times during the night the herd
changed its camping ground. White Sox was
awakened out of a lovely nap each time in order
to follow them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>But next day—well, he had forgotten this;
and it was just as Mother Reindeer had expected
it would be. The fawns had told him wonderful
stories about their wild life. The newness and
excitement of it had so charmed him that the
foolish fellow wanted to stay with his wild cousins
forever and ever.</p>

<p>Mother Reindeer was preparing for her afternoon
nap. She had made herself comfortable on
a nice soft bed of moss where she could see up
the ridge and down the ridge, when White Sox
came to her, all out of breath. He dropped down
on the bed beside her without so much as asking
her leave.</p>

<p>“Mother, I’ve changed my mind,” he said, panting.
“I don’t want to go back to the big herd.”</p>

<p>Mother Reindeer did not say a word. She
wanted to know how much he had learned, and
so she kept quiet till he had breath enough to
tell her. She did not have to wait very long.</p>

<p>“I like this wild life, mother,” he said. “Our
cousins are free to come and go as they please.
They eat on the mossy ranges in winter and on
the grassy slopes in summer. They have sorrels
and mushrooms, foliage of shrubs, and all kinds
of dainties. The fawns are never robbed of their
mothers’ milk. They are never roped and thrown
to the ground by cruel herders. They don’t
have their ears cut and their horns torn off.”</p>

<p>White Sox was all out of breath again because
he had talked so fast. He was quite excited, too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking of my Cousin Bald Face,”
he went on. “If he had lived with the caribou,
he would have been alive today. I shall never
forget his death.”</p>

<p>“Bald Face did not heed his mother’s teaching,
my son,” said Mother Reindeer, gently.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t his fault, mother. I had just been
roped and thrown to the ground. One of the
herders had taken two V’s out of my right ear
and another V out of my left ear—so you’d know
I belonged to you, I suppose—when I saw the
loop of the lasso close over Bald Face’s left horn,
near the end. The poor little fellow was running
his fastest. The herder braced himself and held
the lasso tight. My cousin’s horn was pulled off.
Oh, it was horrible! A piece of Bald Face’s
skull the size of my ear was torn off with the
root of the horn, leaving his brain bare.”</p>

<p>“The herder was a new one,” said Mother
Reindeer. “He had not learned his business.
He will never injure another reindeer in that way.
We must forgive him and try to forget it.”</p>

<p>“Mother, I can’t forget it,” cried White Sox.
“These wild cousins of ours can look forward to
a long life of freedom and safety. They are not
the slaves of herders and dogs. I want to stay
with them.”</p>

<p>“You are very young, my son. You have
much to learn,” said his mother.</p>

<p>“But I know what will happen to me if I stay
with the big herd,” he said. “I’ll have to draw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
heavy sled loads in winter and carry tiresome
packs in summer, if I am not killed by the butcher’s
knife when I am two years old. In that
case the herders will eat my flesh and make
clothing out of my hide. The skin of my white
legs will be used for fancy boots for some herder.”</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">A herder.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Mother Reindeer nodded her head upward and
downward. She knew the ways of the big herd
and had seen these things happen many times.
She knew that if her beautiful White Sox was intended
for a sled deer, he would first have to be
halter-broken. A herder would rope him and tie
him to a piece of tundra surface that was higher
than the rest of the tundra, called a “niggerhead.”
Then would follow the tedious work of
breaking him to harness. He
would be a beast of burden in
winter as long as his back-fat
lasted. Back-fat is the fat that
collects on a reindeer’s back in
summer, when there are green
grass and shrubbery to eat.
Reindeer moss alone does not
give the reindeer strength
enough for much hard work.</p>

<p>If White Sox was broken to
harness, Mother Reindeer
thought it quite likely that he
would be selected by the mail
carrier for that terrible journey
of five hundred miles to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
Kotzebue Sound. But she had reason to believe
that, because of his perfect markings, this wonderful
fawn of hers might escape the butcher’s knife and
the herder’s harness and be kept for a leader of the
big herd. It was because she thought this that she
had brought him with her on a visit to the caribou.</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<p>“Mother,” began White Sox, after thinking
for a little while, “have you forgotten what Uncle
Slim told us just before we became separated from
the big herd?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed! But run away and play with the
fawns now,” she said. “Watch them carefully.
You have not learned your lesson yet.”</p>

<p>Mother Reindeer had intended to take a nap,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
but she had many things to think of after White
Sox left her. Uncle Slim had told them that
probably the big herd would be pastured on the
ice-coated sea beach during the coming winter.
This meant that the sled deer would grow very
thin again. The herders liked to pasture the herd
there so that they could live in their old sod houses
and be near the big village at Point Barrow.</p>

<p>Lack of moss would not be the only drawback;
there was also the terror of the Eskimo dogs.
Slim’s brother had been crippled by a malamute
dog, at Kivalina, when hauling mail on the Barrow-Kotzebue
route. Last December, Slim and five
other reindeer had been staked out for five nights
near Point Barrow village. They were exposed
to a fierce northeast wind while the drivers were
enjoying themselves in the village, where feasting
and dancing were going on. On the fifth night
the wind had changed to the northwest, and the
reindeer had been scented by hungry village dogs.
After a desperate struggle, Slim and the other
reindeer had broken their tethers and had outrun
the dogs. They had run miles and miles back to
the big herd, and so had saved their lives.</p>

<p>It was not all joy in the big herd. Mother
Reindeer knew that very well. Many a time she
too had been tempted to stay with her caribou
cousins and adopt their free life. But always
something had happened to make her change her
mind. She felt sure it would be the same way
with White Sox.</p>

<span class="smcap">White Sox Learns Many Things</span></h2>

<p>When White Sox and the fawns returned from
the brook where the dwarf willows grew, he was
full of a new subject that he could not understand,
and of course he wanted his mother to explain it.</p>

<p>“Mother,” he said, “the water in the brook
was very clear this morning. When I bent my
head to take a drink, I saw the picture of my
antlers. They are not so big and strong as those
of the caribou fawns. There is one little fellow
here—much younger than I—whose upright
branches are longer than mine.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>“Very likely he’ll need his horns more than you
will,” said Mother Reindeer.</p>

<p>“Not if I become a caribou, mother; and I do
so want to stay here and have a good time all my
life,” pleaded White Sox. Then he looked at
her curiously and said, “Mother, the caribou all
seem to have better antlers than the reindeer.
You are like the caribou; your coat is of the same
color when you stand in the deep moss and hide
your white ankles. But your antlers—”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the matter with them?” she
asked, when her son paused.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, mother,” he answered. “Something
seems to be wrong with them. You have
twenty-two points still covered with velvet, but
the points are soft. They curve inward. I don’t
think they would be of much use in a fight.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I,” said Mother Reindeer, “but
I am not expecting to get into a fight. I lost a
set of beautiful antlers when you were born.
Mothers usually lose their horns at such times.
The big herd was kept on the shores of a lagoon
near the beach while my new set was growing.
Mosquitoes were very thick at that place. I had
to keep shaking my head from side to side to beat
off the pests. That constant striking of my growing
horns caused them to curve inward at the ends.”</p>

<p>“The leader of the caribou has a fine set of
antlers,” White Sox told her. “I counted forty-seven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
points, all peeled and sharpened for service.
Will mine ever be like his, mother?”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, my son,” said Mother Reindeer,
kindly. “You’ll grow a new set of antlers each
year. I’ve grown and cast fifteen sets. No two
of them were alike.”</p>

<p>Mother Reindeer knew that the size and shape
of antlers and the number of their points all depended
on the summer range. If she and White
Sox were to adopt the wild life of the caribou,
their antlers would be as large and strong as
those of their wild cousins. But she was too wise
to tell this to her son before he had learned his
first lessons.</p>

<p>Away he skipped. If he could not match the
caribou fawns in antlers, he could equal them in
fleetness. My, how he could run! Mother Reindeer
watched him now, and she thought that his
white stockings looked for all the world like a
streak of snow above the moss. She knew, too,
that his cousins envied him those white stockings,
and she hoped that he would have sense
enough not to become vain of them.</p>

<p>When the second night came, White Sox was very
tired and sleepy. But his wild cousins would not
let him rest in peace. Just about midnight they
decided to move to the next ridge. They were no
sooner comfortably settled there than the leader
ordered them all to another place. When daylight
came, White Sox complained to his mother
about this frequent moving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>“Mother, do our wild cousins never rest and
sleep?” he asked. “I’ve lost more sleep these
two nights than during all the past month. And
tell me, please, mother, why do they eat the
poor, short dry moss on the top of the ridges
and knob hills, when there is much better grazing
in the valleys?”</p>

<p>But Mother Reindeer answered only with a
shake of her wise head. She knew perfectly well
that White Sox might forget the things she told
him, but he would always remember the things
he found out for himself.</p>

<p>While White Sox waited for her to speak, he
saw her turn her head to the right, then to the
left, just as the caribou were always doing—looking
for trouble.</p>

<p>“Mother, you’ve caught their nervous habit,”
he said. “It’s the only thing about our cousins
that I don’t like. Well, if I can’t get enough sleep
here, I’m surely going to have enough to eat.
I’m not going to punish myself by adopting foolish
caribou habits. There’ll be some good moss in
that little valley down there. I’m going to have
it for my breakfast.”</p>

<p>Away he went. Mother Reindeer followed him
quickly. Sure enough, as they crossed a patch
where dwarf willows grew they came upon some
of the finest moss. Um! it made their mouths
water. But do you think White Sox had that
moss for his breakfast? No, indeed!</p>

<p>Mother Reindeer shook her head. “You come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
right up to this other knoll at once,” she ordered,
sternly. “The restless habits of your wild cousins
are not foolish styles, as you’ll soon find out.
Come right along, now, and pay attention to
what I say. Your father once called my ear buttons
a ‘foolish female style,’ but he changed his
mind about it when the herders clamped buttons
on his own ears.”</p>

<p>White Sox followed his mother up the slope to
the little knoll. He did not like it one bit, but
he dared not disobey her. They had barely
reached the high ground when they heard the
frightened squawkings of a flock of ptarmigan,
which rose like a cloud out of another patch of
low arctic willows a few hundred yards from the
spot where they had crossed the little valley.</p>

<p>“Look, look!” exclaimed White Sox, becoming
excited. “I never saw so many ptarmigan before.
I believe there are as many as there are reindeer
in our big herd.”</p>

<p>But Mother Reindeer was looking this way and
that, this way and that, looking and listening,
just as the caribou did.</p>

<p>“Mother!” shouted White Sox, suddenly, “look
at our wild cousins on that other ridge! See how
scared they are! Ptarmigan can’t hurt them.”</p>

<p>“Keep quiet, my son!” commanded his mother.
“That squawking of the ptarmigan is a danger
signal. There’s a hungry fox among the willows
who wanted to make his breakfast off a fat
ptarmigan, or else it is—”</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<p>“What, mother?”</p>

<p>White Sox had crept close to her side; but he
also was looking this way and that, this way and
that.</p>

<p>“It may be a wolf,” said Mother Reindeer.</p>

<p>“A wolf!” repeated White Sox, in a whisper.</p>

<p>“If it were a herder looking for us, we should
see his head and shoulders above the willows.
It must be that a wolf has scented us from afar.”</p>

<p>Mother Reindeer was right. But it was not
<em>one</em> wolf. Hardly had she said the words when
<em>three</em> big gray wolves left the willows by a small
ravine that ended near the herd of frightened
caribou.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>But the caribou could not see the wolves.
White Sox forgot everything except the fact that
his cousins were in danger. He must warn them
instantly.</p>

<p>Before his mother could stop him, he had
given out three piercing bleats, “<em>He-awk! he-awk!
he-awk!</em>”</p>

<p>The very next instant a big black wolf came
out of the willows. It was followed by a gray one.
They started up the slope toward him and his
mother.</p>

<p>“There! You’ve done it!” exclaimed Mother
Reindeer. “Come on! Keep right in my tracks
and don’t turn your head to the right or left.
Do exactly as I do!”</p>

<p>Down the mossy slope she started at her swiftest
speed. At her heels went White Sox, terribly
scared, and thankful that he could run so fast.</p>

<p>For a long time he thought of nothing but
getting away from the fierce wolves. Then he
remembered his cousins. He wondered if they had
heard his signal, if they too were running for
their lives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>Away off—some three miles ahead—Mother
Reindeer had spied a lake, shaped like an hour-glass.
She was making for this lake as fast as
her feet could carry her. Not once did she look
back to see where the wolves were.</p>

<p>To White Sox the lake looked like two patches
of water connected by a narrow neck. He was
thinking as he ran, wondering if his mother would
take him into one of these pieces of water, and if
the wolves would keep them there until the water
froze over. He had been in icy water once.
Some Eskimo dogs had chased him and his uncle
into the Arctic Ocean in July, and had kept them
there until a herder came and drove the dogs
away. His uncle had told him that lakes and
streams would soon begin to freeze; so he knew.</p>

<p>White Sox forgot his mother’s command and
looked back. He had never heard of Lot’s wife
and the pillar of salt. My! How his heart beat
when he saw the two wolves behind him! He
was just going to urge his mother to greater
speed, when his attention was called to something
else.</p>

<p>They were entering a grassy bog. Mother
Reindeer was slowing down to a trot and heading
toward the narrow neck between the two lakes.</p>

<p>At first White Sox was too much surprised to
speak. “It looks as if it weren’t very deep,
mother,” he called warningly. “Let’s make for
the deepest water. Uncle Slim told me that wolves
can’t swim very well in deep water.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>His uncle had also told him that if wolves or
dogs followed them into deep water, reindeer could
strike out with their hoofs and drown their
enemies. But White Sox was too much out of
breath to explain all that to his mother just at
the moment.</p>

<p>But, bless your heart! Old Mother Reindeer
knew all those things, and much more.</p>

<p>“Save your breath, White Sox!” she said
sternly. “Follow me closely and do exactly as
I do.”</p>

<p>Then, instead of hurrying, she went slower and
slower.</p>

<p>White Sox was too much scared to think. He
followed right in his mother’s tracks, getting as
close to her as he could, for he could hear the
whining yips of the wolves behind him.</p>

<p>They had now reached the shore of the narrow
neck between the lakes. Instead of jumping in
and dashing across, Mother Reindeer began to
walk, slowly and very carefully.</p>

<p>“Huh! huh! huh!”</p>

<p>It was the hard breathing of the fierce wolves
close behind White Sox. He was terribly afraid
their fangs would be nipping his hind legs in about
a minute. He made up his mind to bound past
his mother and reach the farther shore ahead of
her.</p>

<p>But, oh my! It was lucky he did not.</p>

<p>That narrow neck was a slough. The water in
it was not water at all. The minute he put his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
foot in that thick, gummy, smelly oil, White Sox
knew why his mother had slowed down. It
reached up to his mother’s knees, and was so
sticky that he could hardly wade through it.
He followed her meekly, with slow and careful
steps.</p>

<p>The slough was about twelve yards across.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Halfway over, White Sox looked back again.
The two wolves had just reached the brink of
the slough.</p>

<p>In they plunged, together, in too great a hurry
to notice the resinous substance. But two jumps
were enough for them. The oil splashed over
their sides and backs. Their great tails became
heavy with it, so heavy that they could hardly
lift them. They turned slowly and waddled back to
the shore in a terrible mess. There was no breakfast
of reindeer meat for them that morning.</p>

<p>Mother Reindeer and White Sox reached the
farther shore and stepped out of the slough.
They stamped their feet to shake off the sticky
stuff, but they couldn’t get rid of it.</p>

<p>Poor White Sox! His beautiful stockings were
dyed a rich black color.</p>

<p>“We are like the caribou now, mother,” he
said sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“Never mind. It will come off when we shed
our hair next July,” Mother Reindeer told him.</p>

<p>White Sox was so thankful at having escaped
the wolves that he did not waste much time in
regrets. He had learned a lesson that morning
that he would never forget.</p>

<p>“Mother, you are the most wonderful reindeer
in all the world,” he said proudly. “But why
didn’t you tell me of your plan of escape?”</p>

<p>“There was no time, my son. Besides, fawns
learn best by seeing and doing.”</p>

<p>“Would the wolves have gone into that shallow
oil slough if we had not held back until they
almost caught us?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not! The wolf is the greediest and
most destructive of all our enemies,” Mother
Reindeer said. “We can only defeat him when
we outwit him and lead him into a trap.”</p>

<p>“I see!” cried White Sox. “If you had not
tempted them to follow us across the sticky
slough, they would have gone around one of the
lakes and would still be chasing us. They cannot
chase us now; their coats are too heavy. Look
at them, mother! They waddle like the porcupines
in the timbered country that Uncle Slim told
us about. Where is the timbered country?”</p>

<p>“It’s about ten days’ journey south of here.”
Mother Reindeer told him. Then she asked him
if he still wished to live with the wild caribou.</p>

<p>“No, no, mother! There were no lame ones
and no old ones among our wild cousins. I wondered
about it yesterday, but now I know the
reason. The wolves caught and ate them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>“Now do you know,” Mother Reindeer asked
him, “why our wild cousins are always looking
this way and that?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” White Sox answered, “I know now.
It’s the wolves. They are always on the lookout
for wolves. They dare not sleep at night for
fear of these enemies. They dare not even graze
in the willow valleys where the best moss grows.
They must have strong, sharp antlers with which
to protect themselves. I understand it all now,
mother. Our wild cousins must ever be on the
watch for these sneaking wolves. No, mother!
No wild caribou life for me! Let us go back to
the tame life of the big herd.”</p>

<span class="smcap">White Sox Travels through a Blizzard</span></h2>

<p>White Sox did not ask if his mother knew the
way back to the big herd. He had learned his
lesson well. Besides, Mother Reindeer had told
him that it was not the first time she had visited
the caribou. When she said, “Come, let us be
off!” he was quite ready to follow without asking
foolish questions.</p>

<p>Away they went at a brisk trot. Both were
glad to be going home. Presently Mother Reindeer
said, “If all goes well, we should reach the
big herd by tomorrow night. I have a story to
tell you before we get there. All reindeer mothers
tell this story to their fawns.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>Mother Reindeer would have told this story to
White Sox long ago, but she had wanted him to
meet his wild cousins first. White Sox was different
from the other fawns, and—well, you’ll understand
after you have heard the story.</p>

<p>They had traveled about ten miles when a
northwest breeze sprang up. The air soon became
full of flying snow. Mother Reindeer changed her
course so that they almost faced the wind. It
was a terrible wind. White Sox had never faced
a blizzard before. He kept close in on his
mother’s side, and he snuggled his head to her
shoulder. In this way they trotted along at
about six miles an hour.</p>

<p>The air became colder and colder. Soon the
snow was like the fog—it walled them in as they
ran. Mother Reindeer did not slacken her speed,
and White Sox felt quite sure it was all right.
But after they had gone about twenty-four miles,
he began to feel very tired and hungry.</p>

<p>“Please let us stop and eat a bit of moss,”
he begged. “We didn’t finish our breakfast,
mother. I want to rest awhile.”</p>

<p>“Not yet, my son,” Mother Reindeer said.
“A little farther on, when we reach the other
side of that ridge, we shall be out of the storm
zone. Then we will rest and eat.”</p>

<p>White Sox thought those last three miles were
the longest he had ever run in his life. He had
never, never been quite so hungry. But on they
went, and at last the ridge was crossed. There was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
nice weather then. And right there on the slope,
under three inches of freshly fallen snow, was a
bed of moss. Um! It was the nicest moss White
Sox had ever tasted.</p>

<p>“Is it because I am so hungry, or because of
the snow, that this moss is so good?” he asked
his mother.</p>

<p>“Both, my son,” she replied. “In summer,
moss is either too dry or too wet. We eat a
little of it, but we like the grass and foliage better.
These produce our back-fat, which we must have
to help us through the winter. Snow gives the
moss the right amount of moisture. We live on
it through the long winter, but every moon we
lose some of our back-fat. We are always glad
when the snow goes and the grass comes.”</p>

<p>“Mother, what is the starvation moon?”
White Sox asked, after they had eaten awhile in
silence. “I have heard Uncle Slim speak of it.”</p>

<p>“That is a spring moon,” said Mother Reindeer,
and then she explained all about it. “When
the herd is kept too near the sea beach and the
snow is deep and hard, reindeer become very poor
and weak. They have to dig through the snow
for all their meals, and there isn’t much to eat
after all their digging. Some reindeer mothers
are so poor when their fawns come that until
the grass grows they don’t have milk enough for
them. There was a starvation moon after your
sister was born, and consequently her growth
was stunted. Luckily for you, last winter and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
spring were what is called ‘open.’ The herders
moved the herd back a day’s journey each moon.
Your mother was in good condition and had
plenty of milk. You grew fast and strong.”</p>
<br>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">“‘Your mother was in good condition, and you grew fast and

</figure>
<br>

<p>White Sox nibbled awhile; then he thought of
something else that he wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Mother, why did we change our course and
go almost directly against the wind when we were
traveling through that blizzard?” he asked.</p>

<p>“That was to protect ourselves from the driving
blast and from wolves,” said Mother Reindeer.
“Don’t you know that our hair slants backward
like the feathers of a duck? A driving wind that
strikes us from behind or on the side gets under
our hair and chills us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>“When we face the wind we can scent wolves
and Eskimo dogs ahead of us. But then wolves
behind us can scent us, can’t they, mother?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my son; but no wolf or dog can face
a blizzard like the snowstorm we passed through
today and overtake a reindeer or a caribou.
Our enemies like to scent us, or see us, and then
sneak up as they tried to do this morning. Our
wild cousins are in the greatest danger when they
are resting.”</p>

<p>“Resting!” exclaimed White Sox. “Why,
mother, our poor cousins don’t know what rest
is! But tell me, please, when the snowflakes
became hard sleet today, didn’t they hurt your
eyes?”</p>

<p>“No, my son. I held my head down in such
a way that one of my branches sheltered my left
eye most of the time. My right eye was protected
by the broad shovel prong over my nose.
I could close my left eye to rest it while running.
Even when we have no horns, we can close one
eye and turn our head so as to protect the other.
Until you have learned this trick, you must always
crowd in on the lee side of a big reindeer
for protection when in a blizzard.”</p>

<p>“I’ll remember that, mother. But I’m very
sleepy now. May I rest awhile?”</p>

<p>“Yes. We’ll go to the top of that little knoll
over yonder. You may sleep while I am chewing
my cud.”</p>

<p>When they, had reached the place, Mother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
Reindeer selected a nice bed of moss covered with
a clean sheet of freshly fallen snow. They needed
no blankets other than their thick, warm coats.
In about two minutes White Sox was fast asleep.</p>

<span class="smcap">Under the Arctic Moon</span></h2>

<p>If you wish to know where White Sox was sleeping,
you must get your geography and turn to
the map of Alaska. Now find the seventy-first
parallel. North of that you will notice a little
point of land jutting out into the Arctic Ocean,
called Point Barrow. Just southwest of that
point is Barrow, the village to which the big herd
belonged.</p>

<p>The little knoll where White Sox was sleeping
was on the seventy-first parallel, away up at the
top of the North American continent. The
freshly fallen snow stretched eastward and westward,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
northward and southward, from this little
knoll; in fact, it covered all the land from the
seventieth parallel to the Arctic Ocean. But
White Sox knew nothing about parallels and such
things. To him that arctic land was the whole
world.</p>

<p>Mother Reindeer knew a lot more than that.
She was seventeen years old. She had seen and
heard so much that she was very wise.</p>

<p>When White Sox waked from his nap, he
thought it was daylight. The brightness dazzled
him. He winked his eyes and looked about him.
A great big arctic moon was shining down upon
him. What a beautiful moon it was! And how
the snow glistened and shone! He winked his
eyes several times; then he looked for his mother.</p>

<p>She was pawing through the snow near him to
get moss for her midnight lunch.</p>

<p>“Mother, this is the whitest world I’ve ever
seen,” he said. Then he sprang up and began to
dig moss for himself, for he was hungry again.</p>

<p>A light breeze was blowing from the northwest,
and the air was much colder. White Sox
rubbed his face against his mother’s shoulder to
brush the frost from his eyes and nose. Then he
took a mouthful of moss and looked about him.</p>

<p>There was not a living thing to be seen. Yes,
there was! A great arctic owl was perched on
a little mound not very far away.</p>

<p>“Mother, are owls as wise as they look?”
White Sox asked. He took another bite of moss.</p>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">“‘He swoops down to catch his own supper and meets his
finish in the sharp claws and teeth of the lynx.’”</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>“No, not always,” Mother Reindeer answered,
“but sometimes they are cunning enough to outwit
sleepy reindeer mothers and kill their newborn
fawns.”</p>

<p>“Do the owls ever get caught by our other
enemies?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes. Among our lesser enemies the
lynx is said to be wiser than the wisest owl.
The lynx eats rabbits, mice, and birds. He
studies the habits of these creatures. He knows
that the owl is always watching to swoop down
on some helpless field mouse. My own mother
told me that when a lynx is hungry for owl meat,
he will burrow in well-packed snow, leaving a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
small opening in the crust about the size of your
tail. He then lies on his back in his snow cave
and pokes his short bobtail through the roof and
wags it to and fro. When the owl sees it, he
thinks it is a field mouse. He swoops down to
catch his own supper and meets his finish in the
sharp claws and teeth of the lynx.”</p>

<p>“The lynx are more cunning than the wolves.
Do you fear them as much, mother?”</p>

<p>“No, my son. When they attack our kind, it
is usually a weak fawn or an injured reindeer.”</p>

<p>“Mother, that little caribou cousin of mine—the
fawn with the big antlers—couldn’t run very
fast. Do you think the wolves would catch him?”
White Sox now asked.</p>

<p>“It’s quite likely they would,” said Mother
Reindeer. “The weaklings always go first to
feed our enemies, and their going helps to save
the strong ones. A wild caribou can never hope
to die a natural death. Our wild cousins know
that at some time or other they must be caught
and eaten by their enemies. Their freedom, which
appeared so attractive to you, is dangerous and
deprives them of protection. Even when some of
their number are always on watch, prowling enemies
will take them by surprise, as they did
yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Mother,” said White Sox, thoughtfully, “knowing
this, why didn’t one of us stand watch while
the other slept?”</p>

<p>“One of us did,” she answered. “I slept the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
‘caribou sleep,’ half a minute on and half a minute
off, while you slept the reindeer sleep.”</p>

<p>White Sox was greatly surprised when he heard
this. He felt that he had been very thoughtless
and selfish. “You should have let me do my
share of watching,” he said.</p>

<p>“You were too tired, my son,” his mother
told him. “Besides, you knew nothing about the
ways of caribou and wolves before we came on
this visit to our cousins. In the big herd the reindeer
sleep long and sound; they have no fear of
enemies. The Eskimo herders and the collies
watch over them. Cowbells frighten the wolves
and scare them away.”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother, I understand that now. Reindeer
life is much safer than caribou life, but—”</p>

<p>“But what?”</p>

<p>White Sox seemed to be puzzled about something.
He thought about it for a minute, and
then he said, “Mother, you never said a word
when the herders killed my two big brothers.
Did you think it right?”</p>

<p>Mother Reindeer did not speak, but she nodded
her head upward and downward, very slowly.</p>

<p>“They killed two of my uncles also,” continued
White Sox, “but they never touched my
sisters or my aunts. And now I come to think
of it, mother, it is always the brothers and uncles
that are killed. Are we born to be eaten?”</p>

<p>Mother Reindeer looked very serious. “It is
time I told you the big story,” she said. “After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
you have heard it you will understand many
things that seem strange to you now. Come, if
you’ve finished your meal. Lie here by my side.
No wolves can surprise us on this knoll. The
beautiful moon is our friend. I am going to tell
you how the first wild caribou was tamed and
became a reindeer.”</p>

<p>After they had made themselves comfortable,
Mother Reindeer said, “First I must tell you
that it will be a white world for seven moons.
From now until we shed our coats next summer,
you may be known in the big herd as ‘Black Sox’!”</p>

<p>Poor White Sox! He looked sadly at his dark
stockings, which were almost as black as the
feathers of a raven; but he answered thoughtfully:
“I am thankful my nose is still white. But I am
not worrying about my name and color. I want to
hear the story of how the first caribou was tamed,
mother.”</p>

<p>This pleased Mother Reindeer very much.
“Good, my son!” she said. “Now for the story!”</p>

<p>And under the bright arctic moon, on the very
top of the great American continent, she told
him the story.</p>

<span class="smcap">Mother Reindeer’s Story of White Feet</span></h2>

<p>“Ever and ever so long ago, on a fine summer
day, a great herd of wild caribou was browsing
near the seashore,” said Mother Reindeer. “This
shore was far away toward the setting sun, across
the great piece of water. There were no reindeer
at the time of which I am speaking. This herd of
caribou was more than ten times as large as our
own big herd. There were so many of them, and
they were so strong, that they had grown careless.</p>

<p>“Wolves did not usually bother the caribou in
summer. There had been no hunters chasing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
them for a long time. The great herd felt quite
safe. It was their custom to keep a few hundred
of their swiftest runners on picket duty all around
the herd, to watch for enemies. But, as I have
just told you, they had grown careless.</p>

<p>“In this great herd of wild caribou was a fawn
with white legs and white nose. He was the
first caribou that ever had any white markings.
All the others were very proud of him. They
named him ‘White Feet.’”</p>

<p>“Did I look like him, mother?” asked White
Sox, who was much interested in the story.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed! You were exactly like him in
every way, my son,” said Mother Reindeer,
proudly. “The fame of this first marked fawn
spread far and wide. Many other bands of caribou
came to see him. They all agreed that he
was born to be king of the caribou. So much attention
caused his mother to be very careful to
train him in the right way. He had many, many
things to learn.”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother. A fawn who is going to be a
great leader must know more than the other reindeer
fawns,” said White Sox.</p>

<p>Mother Reindeer was much pleased at the interest
her son was taking in the story. “That
is very true,” she said. “White Feet was very observing
and thoughtful. He became wise while he
was a fawn. He remembered what his mother told
him. He often thought about it and planned what
he would do when he grew up to be the leader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>“Now, as I told you before, this great herd of
wild caribou felt a little too safe. One fine summer
day, when they were grazing near the shore, a
large band of hungry wolves scented them. These
crafty enemies came nearer and nearer without
the herd’s knowing anything about them. At
last, when they thought they were close enough,
out they rushed. The terrified herd of caribou
stampeded pell-mell into the icy water of the
Arctic Ocean.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” gasped White Sox. “Did the wolves
get many of them?”</p>

<p>“Wait and listen,” said Mother Reindeer.</p>

<p>“White Feet and six other young fawns who always
followed him had gone up on a hill to the
right of the great herd. They were not caught
in the stampede, but they were cut off from the
herd. A large band of fierce wolves was between
them and the caribou. All the fawns except young
White Feet were very much frightened. They
began to ‘mill,’ or run around in a circle. White
Feet remembered what his mother had told him
about wolves. He was only half your age, but
he took command of the little band of fawns and
led them down the other side of the hill, across
a narrow valley, and then up the side of a high
ridge. He planned to get over the summit and
out of sight before any of the wolves began to
look for stragglers.</p>

<p>“When they reached the top of the ridge,
they could see the herd swimming about in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
water. The many antlers looked like a great
mass of brushwood afloat. And they could see
the wolves pacing up and down along the shore,
either too cowardly or too wise to follow the caribou
into the water.</p>

<p>“The fawns stood on the high ridge, their
mouths wide open. Great drops of perspiration
fell from their lolling tongues. Young White
Feet was wondering how long the wolves would
keep the caribou in the icy water, and how he
could lead his little band back to their mothers.
He looked all about him, this way and that,
and what do you think he saw?</p>

<p>“Three big gray wolves were creeping up the
side of the ridge, coming straight toward him and
the fawns.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried White Sox, greatly excited. “What
did he do, mother?”</p>

<p>“He told the fawns to follow him and to do
just as he did,” said Mother Reindeer. “He had
seen a small bay farther along the beach. It
was made by a long, narrow spit of land that curved
like the main branch of my antlers. ‘Come on!’
he cried. ‘It’s a race for life to that little bay
down yonder.’</p>

<p>“Then away he went, with the other six fawns
at his heels. Down, down, down toward the bay
they raced. When they were about halfway there,
White Feet saw smoke ahead. It was coming
from a skin tent that lay between them and
the bay.”</p>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

the big tent.’”</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>“Oh, a herder’s tent!” cried White Sox.</p>

<p>“No, indeed!” said Mother Reindeer. “There
were no herders in those days, my son. It was
the tent of a hunter. White Feet didn’t know
which was the more to be feared, a wolf or a
hunter. Both were the enemies of the caribou.
And the little band of fawns were depending on
him to lead them to safety.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” said White Sox. “A leader must
decide things for himself, and do it quickly. He
can’t ask his mother every time he faces a duty.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mother Reindeer, “and the three
gray wolves forced White Feet to decide quickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
this time. They were coming down the slope
behind the fawns. White Feet knew that the
wolves were gaining on them, but as he looked
ahead, he saw that the tent flap was open. He
felt quite sure that his little band could not reach
the bay, and he had been told that wolves would
avoid a hunter’s tent in daylight. But these
beasts thought they were surely going to have a
big feed of fawn meat.</p>

<p>“White Feet shouted to his followers to turn
and dash into the tent. Then, just as the first
wolf was about to seize the hindermost fawn, he
and his little band swerved to one side and burst
into the big tent.</p>

<p>“Whiz! whiz! whiz!</p>

<p>“The native hunter, all unknown to the fawns
and wolves, had been watching the race from behind
the tent. Three gray wolves now lay on
the ground outside, pinned fast by the hunter’s
terrible arrows.”</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, mother!” cried White Sox, who
was trembling with excitement. “Did the hunter
kill White Feet and his six fawns?”</p>

<p>Mother Reindeer looked at her son for a
moment in silence and then continued her story.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VIII">VIII<br>
<span class="smcap">The First Human Friend</span></h2>

<p>“Inside the big tent,” Mother Reindeer went
on, “a woman and her three children squatted
near the fire. They were eating a freshly cooked
duck. They were so taken by surprise when the
little band of caribou fawns dashed in through
their open tent flap that at first they could not
speak or move. Then the mother sprang up and
fastened the tent flap tight.</p>

<p>“White Feet and his followers had come to a
stop at the farther side of the tent. They stood
bunched together, with heads erect. All but
White Feet were shaking with fear. They had
seen the woman close the tent flap. They knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
that they were prisoners now, and they thought
that they had escaped one death only to meet
another. Then they saw the tent flap open a little
way. The hunter peeped in; then he opened it
wider, slipped inside the tent, and closed the flap
quickly.</p>

<p>“White Feet noticed that the hunter carried
his big bow in his hand. He noticed also that
he and his family all wore clothes made of caribou
skins. They spoke to each other in strange
sounds such as the fawns had never before heard.
They all appeared to be very much excited and
pleased. They looked at the fawns, and the fawns
looked at them.</p>

<p>“Suddenly the bigger boy gave a loud cry
and pointed at White Feet. The hunter and the
others looked at White Feet, too. Then they
talked in excited tones.</p>

<p>“White Feet, of course, didn’t know what they
were saying, but he felt quite sure that they were
talking about his white markings. Oh, how he
wished his mother had been with him! Then he
remembered that a leader must not think of himself
when others depend on him. Here were the
six poor little fawns scared half to death, and he
had promised to take care of them. What should
he do?</p>

<p>“He looked at the bigger boy, and the bigger
boy looked at him. There was something in the
boy’s eyes that gave White Feet courage. He
didn’t seem like an enemy. He stood near his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
father, but his head came only as high as the
hunter’s elbow.</p>

<p>“White Feet made up his mind to trust this
boy. Then he did the boldest thing ever done by
a caribou. He walked across the tent to where
the bigger boy stood and rubbed his head against
the boy’s arm.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” gasped White Sox. “How brave he
was!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mother Reindeer, “that little caribou
fawn was the first of his kind to try to make
friends with an enemy. Of course the boy was
surprised. He touched White Feet on the head.
He spoke kindly to him and patted his shoulder.
All the others stopped talking and watched them.</p>

<p>“The bigger boy stooped down and stroked
White Feet’s beautiful stockings. White Feet
rubbed his head against the boy’s arm again and
tried to tell him how much he wanted him for
a friend.</p>

<p>“The boy’s young sister wanted to touch the
fawn’s pretty stockings. She was a little bit
afraid. She moved close beside the bigger boy,
put out her hand very carefully, and just touched
the top of the nearest white stocking. Then she
laughed, and the two boys laughed, and their
mother laughed. And what do you think White
Feet did?</p>

<p>“<em>He kissed that little girl.</em> Yes, he did—right
on the cheek. He licked her cheek with his warm
tongue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>“The little girl wasn’t a bit afraid of him after
that. She stroked his white stockings, talked baby
talk to him, and then she put her arms about his
neck and loved him.</p>

<p>“White Feet felt pretty sure that the
children would not let the hunter kill him—just
then. But he had to think for Blackie—the other
male fawn of his little band—and the five does.
He told Blackie and the doe fawns to make friends
with the other boy and his mother. At first they
were too scared to move, but at last poor Blackie got
courage enough to walk up to the younger boy and
rub his head against his arm. This seemed to please
the younger boy very much. Before long all the doe
fawns had followed his example, and the human
beings were laughing and talking kindly to them.</p>

<p>“The hunter had been shaking his head, but now
he nodded it upward and downward. White Feet
felt sure that he was saying ‘yes’ to what the
children had been asking, and that none of the
little band would be killed at once. White Feet
watched the hunter very carefully, but he kept
close to the bigger boy because the boy was his
first friend.</p>

<p>“After a little while the hunter made two small
halters of sealskin rope. He put one over White
Feet’s head and the other over Blackie’s. Then
the bigger boy led White Feet out of the tent and
on to the narrow spit. The younger boy led Blackie.
The five doe fawns followed them, and so did the
little girl and her mother and father.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p>“When they were all far out on the spit, the
hunter stretched his fish net across the narrow
neck of ground. White Feet and his band were
now prisoners on the spit. They were very glad
to be alive and safe from the wolves. They didn’t
know how long the hunter would let them live,
and oh! how they did want their mothers! But
they were very hungry too, and when White Feet
saw some nice grass and scrubby willows, you
may be quite sure that the little band forgot their
troubles and ate a good supper.</p>

<p>“Afterward White Feet examined the long,
narrow spit. It was low and rolling, and most of it
was covered with moss and grass. There were dwarf
willows too, and along its western shore, under a long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
bluff, was a level drift of old winter snow. The place
looked mighty good to White Feet, especially when
he found that the children were going to live on
the sand spit with them. That very night the
hunter and his family moved their tent inside the
fish-net corral. The little band of fawns had a
long sleep in perfect safety.</p>

<p>“Next day the hunter and his wife stood and
watched the fawns play with the children. The
hunter seemed to be most interested in White
Feet. When he spoke to him, White Feet would
go right up to the hunter and rub his head
against the man’s arm or leg. You see, White
Feet had thought it all out and decided that the
band must have the hunter for a friend; then their
lives would be safe. But of course the hunter
didn’t know that. He was very much puzzled.
He stared at White Feet and talked to him as if
the fawn with the unheard-of markings were the
returned spirit of his dead father, who had been
a chief and a mighty hunter. After a few days
the hunter went away.</p>

<p>“The captive fawns soon forgot their sorrow
and fear. The spit was a safe home. They had
a variety of forage and plenty of it. They had
loving companions. They could sleep soundly without
fear of enemies. It was a new life to them and
they liked it.</p>

<p>“The bigger boy’s name was Dainten. White Feet
soon discovered that. The two were together
nearly all the time. They loved each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>“But White Feet always remembered that the
hunter and his family dressed in caribou skins.
This made him very thoughtful. He felt quite
sure that if all his followers were allowed to live
and grow up, they must find a way to be of use
to the hunter.”</p>

<span class="smcap">White Feet Finds a Way of Serving Man</span></h2>

<p>“One day,” continued Mother Reindeer, “some
driftwood was washed up by the sea. Dainten
pulled the pieces up on the beach. He found
two that were crooked near the end. These
pieces were of the same length, and the crooked
ends were bent in about the same way.</p>

<p>“White Feet smelled at them, but he couldn’t
make out what Dainten intended to do as he watched
him place the two pieces side by side, a short
distance apart. Dainten then took some shorter
pieces of driftwood, placed them crosswise on the
others, and lashed them fast with sealskin thongs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
It was a strange-looking thing he had made.
The crooked ends bent upward. To the crosspiece
nearest these he fastened a stout rope of
sealskin thongs. He then placed his little sister
and brother on the thing and pulled them over
the snow.”</p>

<p>“I know!” exclaimed White Sox, quickly.
“That was a sled.”</p>

<p>“It was,” said Mother Reindeer. “White
Feet stood and watched them use the sled. He
was doing some hard thinking. He wanted to do
everything he saw Dainten do. When the bigger
boy had given his little brother and sister one
ride, White Feet asked Dainten to let him draw
the sled. Of course Dainten didn’t know what
White Feet was saying; but when White Feet
put his neck under the rope and tried to take his
place in front of the sled, Dainten began to understand.</p>

<p>“He laughed and patted White Feet. He put
the rope around his neck and tied it so it would
not slip and choke him. Then he tied a small
piece of rope to the right side of the halter band
that White Feet was still wearing, and another
piece to the left side. It was the hour after sunset.
The snow, which had been soft and mushy
at noon, was now hard and crusted.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="image055" style="max-width: 42.8125em;">

</figure>
<br>

<p>“Dainten took his place on the front end of the
sled and held the lines in his hands. His sister
and brother sat behind him. When all was ready,
he gave a slap of the lines on the fawn’s sides.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>White Feet understood. He started very slowly
and carefully, but he found that the loaded sled
was easy to draw over the trail of hard snow.
When Dainten urged him to go faster, he broke
into a trot. All the other fawns joined the party.
It was wonderful fun.</p>

<p>“On their return to the starting place, Dainten
thought he would see how fast they could go. He
gave a harder slap of the lines. Away they went
down the gentle slope. The snow from the hind
hoofs of White Feet hit their faces and made the
children laugh. How glad they were, and how
happy! And how proud White Feet was to be of
service to them!</p>

<p>“They were going so fast as they neared the
bottom of the slope that White Feet could not keep
ahead of the sled. To prevent its running against
his heels, he swerved to the left, giving the riders
a great spill.”</p>

<p>“Mother, that’s a wonderful story!” cried
White Sox. “That was the first sled reindeer,
the first reindeer harness, the first reindeer ride,
and the first spill!”</p>

<p>“Yes, my son,” said Mother Reindeer, “the
very first. It was the beginning of a new kind of
service to man. As I told you before, the hunter
was away. He came home while the children were
sledding on the snow. He stepped from his boat
and watched them in great surprise. And oh,
how he laughed when the sled upset! He patted
White Feet and spoke kindly to him, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
nodded his head upward and downward several
times. Then he put the harness on Blackie and
tied him in front of the little sled.</p>

<p>“White Feet told Blackie to watch for the signal
and go very carefully. Dainten’s brother
drove him. Blackie did good work. You see, he
had watched White Feet and had learned how to
do as he did. Dainten’s brother was very proud
of Blackie.</p>

<p>“After a while the hunter went to his boat.
All the children and the fawns followed him to see
what he had brought from his hunting trip.
First he took out a lot of ducks, some geese, and
a swan. Then he unloaded a great many brown
and white ptarmigan. His wife was much pleased
when she saw that he had brought her two hair
seals. She and the children carried the birds and
dragged the seals up to the tent. But the fawns
didn’t follow then. The hunter was pulling some
fresh caribou skins out of his boat.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried White Sox, in excitement.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mother Reindeer, “and the very
first skin White Feet smelled at was his own
mother’s. The neck and hind legs were all chewed
up by the teeth of wolves. Of course he felt
very badly about it. The world seemed a lonely
place to him after losing his mother. But he
knew again that a leader must not think of himself.
He smelled at the other skins. They all
showed the teeth marks of wolves, and all of them
were the skins of old mothers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>“White Feet knew that the old mothers were
usually the weaklings of the herd. Their death
saved many fawns from being caught. Then it
came to White Feet that the death of these
mothers might be the means of saving his own little
band of fawns. The hunter and his family would
now have plenty of caribou skins for the coming
winter. They would not need his and Blackie’s
and those of the doe fawns.</p>

<p>“It was while White Feet was smelling at the
skins that Dainten returned from the tent. The
boy stood beside White Feet and looked at him,
just for all the world as if he understood that the
poor torn skin had belonged to White Feet’s
mother. From that minute Dainten and White
Feet became lifelong friends. Dainten patted the
fawn and tried to comfort him. To White Feet
a human being had taken the place of his own
dear old mother.</p>

<p>“Later, the hunter helped the boys make better
harness for White Feet and Blackie. It was the
kind now used by our herders. Instead of the
curved piece of wood for each shoulder, he used
a strap of sealskin about as broad as your ear,
placing it over the left shoulder and neck and between
the fore legs. The two ends of this band
were fastened to the end of the single trace, back
of the right fore leg, where they passed under the
belly band. The trace stretched from the ends
of the collar band to the sled, outside of the
right hind leg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>“With these harnesses the hunter trained White
Feet and Blackie to work together. He was well
pleased with them and sent his five dogs to his
brother, who lived a day’s journey down the beach.
The hunter knew that it would require much of
the dried meat he had put up through the summer
to feed his team dogs through the winter. His
new sled deer didn’t eat meat. That meant less
work for the hunter and his wife.</p>

<p>“Of course the hunter was anxious to try out
these sled deer with a heavy load. Luckily for
White Feet and Blackie, their muscles were hard
and strong by the time the first new snow came.
They had plenty of back-fat too. All their work
had been but play, but now they were to be of
real service to man. The hunter’s supplies,
gathered during the summer, must be moved from
the spit to a small grove of alders a day’s journey
inland. This was the hunter’s winter home.”</p>

<span class="smcap">The Hunter Becomes a Herder</span></h2>

<p>“The first load hauled by White Feet and
Blackie,” continued Mother Reindeer, “consisted
of the tent skins and poles, sleeping skins, clothing,
cooking pots, and part of the stock of dried
fish. It was a big load, but it looked bigger than
it really was. The other native people were very
much surprised to see such a load drawn by two
pastured caribou fawns.</p>

<p>“On the following day White Feet and Blackie
were so tired and stiff that Dainten tethered them
out in a good moss patch near the winter camp.
His brother and sister kept watch over them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
The five doe fawns stayed near White Feet and
Blackie. The hunter made them a small corral
of alders, so that his little herd would be well
protected from wolves in the nighttime.</p>

<p>“This hunter was a wise man. He knew that
when wild caribou had been chased for several
days they became very thin and poor. He now
found that moss was not so strengthening to the
fawns as meat was to the dogs. He wished to
keep the little herd until they were grown up;
so he took good care of them and allowed them to
rest well before he took them back to the summer
camp for another big load. You see, my son, the
fierce hunter was becoming a good herder. The
taming of the fawns had also tamed him and his
family. The pastured caribou fawns were now
called reindeer.”</p>

<p>“Did they never see any of the wild caribou
again?” White Sox asked.</p>

<p>“No, not to speak to,” Mother Reindeer said,
“but they soon became used to the ways of their
human friends and were quite content. Before
the November moon was gone, all the seal oil,
dried fish, and meat had been hauled from the
spit to the winter camp. The hunter had more
than enough food stored up for his family; so he
gave his attention to studying the ways and
habits of caribou and taking care of his first little
herd of reindeer.</p>

<p>“On clear days, and on nights when the moon
was shining, he had the children take turns at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
watching the herd while it grazed. He took the
sharp claws of the big Oogarook seals and fastened
them to the ends of pieces of alder, about
as big as your hoof. These made fine rakes or
moss scratchers. The children used these scratchers
for digging moss, which they put inside the
corral for the fawns to eat on stormy days and dark
nights. The first herder was a thoughtful man; he
didn’t want his herd to grow thin and poor.”</p>

<p>“He was more thoughtful than some of our
herders that Uncle Slim tells about,” said White
Sox.</p>

<p>Mother Reindeer nodded her head. “The first
herder and his family had become so fond of
their reindeer that they all seemed like one
family,” she said. “The human beings couldn’t
understand the caribou language, but White Feet
and his band soon came to understand many native
words. Dainten’s brother was named Tah-ne-na.
His sister’s name was Tah-nes-ka.”</p>

<p>White Sox had listened carefully to every word
his mother had said. To him it was a very wonderful
story. The more he thought about it, the
more he wished to be like White Feet in mind as
well as in body. After pondering for a while in
silence, he said:</p>

<p>“I can see all the pictures now, mother—the
careless caribou herd, the sneaking wolves, and
the little band of fawns on the hill. Always the
weakest of the herd were sacrificed in order that
the stronger ones might escape and live a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
while longer. Always danger, unrest, and fear!
I see the other pictures—one brave caribou fawn
thinking and planning for the safety of those who
depended on him, and boldly doing things no
other caribou had ever dared to do. I see that
first corral on the narrow spit, the first little sled
and harness, the first little caribou serving man
for the love of him. Each needed something the
other had to give. The fawns needed protection.
The human beings needed beasts of burden that
would be a source of food, instead of those for
whom food had to be provided.”</p>

<p>White Sox had learned his lesson. Mother Reindeer
felt proud of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>“But listen, son,” she said. “I have not yet
finished my story. The first little herd of reindeer
increased in numbers as the years went by,
doubling their number every third spring. The
two boys grew to manhood and married, and had
families of their own. The old hunter and his
wife died. There came a time when the herd was
too large for the corrals. Dainten and Tah-ne-na
had to take on new herders to help with the work.
They now herded their reindeer in the open, day
and night.”</p>

<p>“We are not herded at night, mother,” White
Sox said.</p>

<p>“That is true, my son,” said Mother Reindeer.
“On this side of the big waters there are not so
many wolves. Our herders watch us at night
only during the season when the ground is bare
and we are inclined to scatter.”</p>

<p>“How did you get across the big waters,
mother?”</p>

<p>“That is what I’m going to tell you now,”
she said.</p>

<span class="smcap">How Mother Reindeer Came to Alaska</span></h2>

<p>“At last the herd became so big that it had to
be divided,” said Mother Reindeer. “Dainten
had always claimed White Feet. Tah-ne-na had
claimed Blackie. Now Dainten took all the spotted
and white reindeer and moved toward the rising sun,
where his wife’s people lived. Tah-ne-na had only
the dark reindeer for his herd. He moved toward
the setting sun, where his wife’s people had come
from. They moved the two herds so far apart
that they could never mingle again. Tah-ne-na’s
herd multiplied and stocked the shores toward the
setting sun. Dainten’s herd increased rapidly and
spread along the shores toward the rising sun.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>“You belonged to Dainten, didn’t you,
mother?” White Sox asked.</p>

<p>“Dainten and White Feet had been dead for
ages and ages before I was born,” said Mother
Reindeer. “I belonged to one of the herds that
descended from White Feet. My mother was a
beautiful spotted reindeer, and my father was a
great leader of a band of wild caribou. When I
was a fawn, all the members of our family were
roped and hobbled. We were taken on board a
big floating corral and brought across the waters
to a place some thirty days’ journey from here.
That floating corral was a long, narrow, smoky,
noisy, quivering thing that moved over the surface
of the waters toward the rising sun. It was a
dreadful journey. Our mothers were too much
scared to eat. The fawns were bleating all the
time. For two suns there was no land anywhere
in sight—nothing but water and fog, water and
fog. We didn’t know what the herders were going
to do to us. We were all very much afraid.</p>

<p>“At last we came to another shore. The floating
corral moved close up to the land and we were
taken off. The place was strange. The people
were strange. We were still very much afraid,
but it was better to be on shore than on the
floating corral. After a few days the floating corral
came again and landed more reindeer. We were
very glad to see our old friends, and we grew
more contented.</p>

<p>“But in this new land we had strange men for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
herders, to help our own herders who came with
us on the floating corral. They were too old to
learn how to take care of us. After a while we
had more new herders, men who wore shoes that
curved up at the toes, like boat sleds. They wore
high caps stuffed with feathers and spoke a strange
language. They threw the lasso straight, without
warning, instead of curling it three times around
overhead before shooting it out. But at last we
had some young men for herders, and they did
much better by us. Young people are like fawns;
they learn quickly. It was then that we began
to love the new land and our new herders.”</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>“You’ve seen a great deal, mother, but how did
you get up here, thirty days’ journey from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
place where you first lived in this new land?”
White Sox asked.</p>

<p>“That’s another story, my son,” Mother Reindeer
said. “I will tell you about it after all your
other lessons are learned. This much I will tell
you now. One day some strange men came to
our new land and talked with our herders. In
a little while two reindeer herds on this side of
the big waters were put together and driven north.
The little bit of winter daylight had just begun
to grow longer as we started. We didn’t know
where we were going, but we thought it must be
on a long trip, because some sleds were loaded with
food for the herders who were driving us.</p>

<p>“Our journey was on both land and sea. The
sea was frozen over. We were on it two days and
nights. Our sleds could not haul enough moss to
feed the entire herd. The weak reindeer dropped
on the ice and were left behind. Some ate too
much of the salty frost that covered the ice. It
made them thirsty. They became faint and were
left behind. After we left the ice, our way lay
across a mountainous country. When we had
crossed that, wolves scented us and followed us
many nights. It was a hard journey, much too
hard and long for mothers at that time of the
season.</p>

<p>“But at the end of the second moon we reached
the place near the sea beach, where we now live.
There we found many floating corrals among the
ice and many strange men in houses. Then came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
the most terrible part of it all. Half the herd was
butchered and hauled into the village where the
men were.”</p>

<p>“Mother!” exclaimed White Sox, in horror.
“Did they kill all the males at once?”</p>

<p>“There were but few males in the herd,” she
answered. “Many of those killed were mothers
and sisters. We didn’t understand it. But your
grandmother—her name was Spot—talked with
a wild caribou that came near the herd. He told
her that hunters had killed a great many wild caribou
that winter and taken their bodies to the village.
Together they reasoned it out that the men had
no other kind of food, and that we had
been brought there to keep that great herd of
men from starving. Spot was a sled deer—”</p>

<p>“I thought you said she was my grandmother,”
White Sox broke in. “Did the reindeer mothers
have to draw sleds after the big killing?”</p>

<p>“Spot did,” said Mother Reindeer. “Your
Uncle Slim was a fawn then. He trotted along
beside her when she pulled the loaded sled.
The herders made a little harness for him and
worked him with his mother.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>That was the end of Mother Reindeer’s story.
If you want to know more about the big killing
at Point Barrow, you must read about how the
whaling vessels were frozen in the ice there and how
more than two hundred white men were reported
starving during the coldest part of the long winter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
The herders sacrificed their reindeer to save the
lives of these men. Of course Mother Reindeer
did not know anything about whaling vessels;
she called a ship a floating corral. But she was a
wise old mother reindeer, for all that. Don’t
you think so?</p>

<span class="smcap">White Sox Learns His Last Lesson</span></h2>

<p>White Sox and his mother had been silent for
a long time. But White Sox was not asleep; he
had a great deal to think about, and he had just
made up his mind that he must not be a baby any
longer. He had been to school and had learned
many lessons. He must be a leader now. And
now was the time for him to make a start.</p>

<p>“Mother,” he said, after he had looked about
him this way and that, this way and that, “the
moon is going to bed. I see a little streak of daylight
creeping over the edge of the world. Let us
take a run through that little valley below and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
finish our lesson on the top of that ridge to the
north of here, after we have eaten some breakfast.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Mother Reindeer. She rose
and stretched herself, but she did not offer any
advice. She wanted to see what kind of leader
White Sox would make.</p>

<p>First he tried to find which way the breeze was
blowing. Then he turned his nose in that direction
and sniffed several times. But not a thing
could he scent. He looked very carefully everywhere.
But not a thing could he see.</p>

<p>“Come on!” he cried; and down the knoll he
started at a swift trot. He was thinking how
much he wished to be like White Feet, but all
the same he kept a sharp lookout to the east and
to the west while he kept his nose turned to the
north.</p>

<p>There was plenty of fine moss being trampled
under his feet, but he did not stop to taste it.
Up, up he went, to the very top of the next low
ridge. When he saw that all was safe, he began
to feed on the splendid moss under the blanket
of snow.</p>

<p>Presently he looked up and said, “White Feet
died a natural death, didn’t he, mother?”</p>

<p>“Yes, so we are told,” Mother Reindeer answered.
“But he reached a ripe old age before
he died.”</p>

<p>White Sox ate awhile in silence; then he spoke
again. “I think I understand it all now, mother.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
White Feet was allowed to live because his services
to man were of more value than his flesh
and skin. He was a great leader and a wise
teacher. He taught his herd and their offspring
obedience to man and thankfulness for protection.
He changed the order of things entirely.</p>

<p>“In olden times the poor mothers were sacrificed
to feed the wolves. Now the sons are sacrificed
to feed man, their protector. The sons pay the
debt which enables the mothers to live in peace
and safety.”</p>
<br>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">“‘In olden times the poor mothers were sacrificed to feed the
wolves.’”</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>“Yes, my son,” said the proud mother, “and
you must know that the wild caribou have decreased
in numbers year by year; but the reindeer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
under the protection of man, have multiplied
until now they form many mighty herds.”</p>

<p>“That proves that the new way is better,
mother,” said White Sox. “Service and sacrifice
for the males! That is now our law. That is
why you didn’t complain when my two big brothers
were butchered.”</p>

<p>Mother Reindeer nodded her head.</p>

<p>“Our worst enemies did us a kind turn when
they stampeded White Feet and his little band
into the hunter’s tent,” continued White Sox.
“And man, our next worst enemy, did us a better
turn when he taught us to serve him. Mother, if I
am to live to a ripe old age and die a natural
death, I must make myself so useful to man that
my services will be of greater value than my flesh
and skin. Isn’t that right, mother?”</p>

<p>“That’s the whole lesson, my son,” Mother
Reindeer said. “And now I will tell you that I
have always wanted to be the mother of a second
White Feet. I was pleased because you were marked
like the great leader, but I am more pleased that
you are able to think like him. A leader has to
face many trials of courage and many temptations,
and has great cares and responsibilities. It
is only by overcoming all temptations and weaknesses
and by boldly doing your duty that you
become of great service to man and to your kind.”</p>

<p>White Sox nodded his head. “Yes, mother,”
he said thoughtfully. “I’ve been worrying about
my spoiled stockings and what the herd would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
think of these black ones, but now I’m glad my
legs are black. By the time the hair comes next
summer, and my new white stockings appear, I
shall have learned many more lessons. I’ve one
more question to ask. Do you ever wish to return
to the land where White Feet lived?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the kind old mother, “this is a
better land for reindeer. The moss here is better.
We have more timber, better sleds and harness,
good herding dogs to help keep off our enemies,
and good herders. I’m getting old, my son, but
I hope to live to see you leader of the big
herd—as wise and useful as your great ancestor.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, mother dear,” he said gently.
“Thank you for telling me the big story. My!
what a foolish fawn I was—wanting to stay
with our wild cousins! How glad I am the wolves
chased us away!”</p>

<p>He looked to the north, then to the west. He
sniffed the air and turned this way and that, this
way and that. At last he turned to the north and
looked very steadily.</p>

<p>What do you think he saw?</p>

<p>A cloud of fog was rising from the ground. It
was only a few miles ahead of them. The morning
sky was bright and clear. The air was very
cold.</p>

<p>“It looks like fog, but it can’t be fog,” he said
doubtfully. Then he became excited.</p>

<p>“Mother, our big herd is right yonder where
that fog bank is,” he shouted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, my son,” said Mother Reindeer. “That
fog cloud is their frozen breath.”</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried White Sox.</p>

<p>Away he dashed, with Mother Reindeer at his
heels.</p>

than this. It makes a stirring appeal to the imaginations
of boys and girls, and holds the interest of all from

valuable and unfamiliar denizens of the North seas. Did
you know that seals shed tears and groan when emotionally
aroused? That they always return to their home in
the spring after spending the winter in the South? These
and other fascinating tidbits make it of interest to older
persons too. The book is illustrated from photographs
and drawings by Chloe Leslie Starks.</p>

<p class="center no-indent fs90 wsp"><em>Lecturer, University of California; Geography Supervisor, Berkeley
Public Schools</em></p>

<p class="no-indent">A small book bringing out in a simple and interesting manner the
principles of conservation of natural resources has long been wanted,
for there has been little on the subject that could be placed in the hands
of pupils. It is to answer this need that Fairbanks’ <span class="smcap">Conservation
Reader</span> has been prepared.</p>

<p class="no-indent">The book touches upon every phase of conservation, but it deals at
greatest length with saving the soil, the forests, and wild life. It is one
of the author’s main purposes to arouse a stronger sentiment for preserving
what remains of the forests as well as for extending their areas.
This is because proper forestation will lessen the danger of floods and
of erosion of the soil, and it will encourage the return of the wild creatures
that are of so much economic importance and add so much to the
joy of life.</p>

<p class="no-indent">The matter is presented in an easy narrative style that is calculated to
arouse the intelligent interest of children. The text is illustrated with
photographs of wild animals, trees, landscapes, and rarely beautiful
birds, printed in colors. The subject is timely and the treatment is
happy throughout.</p>
